    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    let team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[0] = "foo";

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team);
    players[0] = "Wes";

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    let team1 = players.slice();
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let team2 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let team3 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team1[0] = "foo";
    team2[0] = "foo";
    team3[0] = "foo";
    console.log(players, team1, team2, team3);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    let person = { name: "bar", age: 100 }

    // with Objects
    let you = person;

    // and think we make a copy:
    you.age = 20;
    console.log(person, you);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let me = Object.assign({}, person, { iq: 1 });
    me.age = 50;
    console.log(me, you);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    let catPerson = { name: "catPerson", age: 100, cats: { first: "bar", sec: "baz" } }
    let catMe = Object.assign({}, catPerson);
    console.log("bar", catPerson, catMe);
    catMe.cats.first = "foo";
    console.log(catPerson, catMe);
